A collection of my utility scripts/programs

**catdir - An utility script for Android/Linux to view the file name and contents of it, especially useful when dealing with CPU related files (Functionality = major)
**filetype - A script to find files with their extension, additionally you can view, edit and look up the attributes of the files. (Functionality = major)
*initialsetup - An ever updating script to setup my pc on a fresh install (Functionality = N/A, this is only a template. I cannot share all on a public repo XD)
**pullAPK.sh - A simple yet effective script to backup and reinstall backed up APK without user interaction (Functionality = major)
*s777 - A cool script to create and set 777 permissions to any file (Functionality = minimal)
